My favorite piece of academic work I made at Carleton is probably my document analysis of the *Pravda Russkaia* for HIST 2600. The *Pravda Russkaia* created by **Prince Iaroslav the Wise** is a code of customary laws that was created in 11th century Kievan Rus. In my paper, I argued the historical significance of the document and how it allowed us to have a glimpse at the values and behaviors of Kievan Rusâ€™ society in the 11th century. A fun example of a law was the fine for cutting another mans beard. This fine was equal to the fine one would pay for stealing a slave. The quirkiness and oddly specific laws written in this document made it both fun and valuable in my analysis, and thus it holds the title for my favorite academic work.
