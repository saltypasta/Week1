#Getting started with markdown

-Installed Atom as a text editor

-Might switch to markdown pad 2 as it has a live preview of what my work will look like on github
  
-read the basics of markdown found [here](https://craftingdh.netlify.app/tutorials/markdown/)

-[Markdown Cheatsheat is very handy](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)

-Creative commmons is a good resource for images licenced for reuse. I found it a little tricky to find niche stuff

  -Normal for images not to appear right away
  
#Its github time

-Set up my account, easy peasy

-time to make a repository, i got this

-yeah so i should have checked off the ‘initialize with a readme.md’ button like the instructions said

-deleted that repository and made a new one. Cool that in settings there is a 'Danger zone'. Makes me feel like a badass.

-well turns out there was a way to [fix](https://craftingdh.netlify.app/tutorials/github/) the repository i already made so thats good to know

-When uploading a file, you have to actually use file explorer or browse files... you cant drag and drop from atom. Atom does have a 'stage' to github feature but i have no idea what that is

-Github done. that wasnt so bad!

#Anaconda

-turns out i already had python installed. Checked installation in powershell and it says i have python 3.7.6 installed, which is an **older version**. If I have problems later this could be why

-navigated the command line no problem... seems too good to be true. Ill take it though.
